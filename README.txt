== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a Usercentrics Account in order to use the plugin? =

Yes. If you don't have a [Usercentrics Account](https://usercentrics.com/pricing/?partnerid=7749 "Usercentrics Account") yet, you will need to create one first.

= Do I need to have a Google Tag Manager Account? =

No, there's no obligation to have a Google Tag Manager (GTM) Account. If you want to use Google Tag Manager though, you'll need to create a GTM account first. If you already have one, it is highly recommended to remove any previous GTM embeddings and use the plugin's implementation instead. All you got to do is enter your GTM Container ID.
